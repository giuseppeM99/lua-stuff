# MimeType library
### a simple mimetype database and wrapper for lua

The original library came from https://github.com/LucentW/s-uzzbot/blob/master/libs/mimetype.lua

The gen.lua script has been taken and modified from https://bitbucket.org/simbiose/lua-mimetypes/src/2a3a2eb8e4e86dd84697a62484fae8506ca84aa5/generate.lua to fit the old sintax of mimetype.lua

https://github.com/LucentW/s-uzzbot/blob/master/libs/mimetype.lua#L6 DONE!

If you want to preserve some bytes (arond 5217) you can use genshrink.lua but i don't think it's a good idea.
